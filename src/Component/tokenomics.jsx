                        There are two native tokens on the dFuse platform.The first is $BOMB and the second is
                        $veBOMB or voting escrowed Bomb.$BOMB is the primary token of dFUSE platform.It is earned by

                        <br />
                        $veBOMB is similar to Curveâ€™s voting escrowed token $veCRV.It is earned by staking $BOMB.
                        0.01 $veBOMB is earned for every hour that you stake $BOMB.More $veBOMB means more LP rewards.
                        $veBOMB can not be traded or transferred.Whenever the underlying $BOMB is unstaked, the $veBOMB
                        balance drops to 0.
